The Change Password Page

= Introduction =

A user may wish to change their password. They may have had their password revealed to others or simply change their password periodically for good security practices.

The Change Password form requires the user to be logged in.  In addition the person must enter their current password, new password and a confirmation of their new password to successfully complete the process.

An email is sent to the account owner notifying them of the password change. The message provides contact details for the webmaster in the event the password change was not authorized.
