Prerequisites Of The Web Site Deploying The Login System

= Introduction =

The web site is expected to have certain capabilities.


= Details =

The web site will need one of the server side languages:

  * ASP, or
  * PHP

The web site will need a database:

  * MS Access on a Windows Server,
  * MS SQL, (including an express version, formerly MSDE), or
  * MySql

The web server will need a valid SSL certificate. A change has been made to the global configuration file which may allow the use of shared SSL certificates for some hosts.  This may not apply to all ISP implementations of shared SSL, but may make the Login System more accessible to some developers.

The web site would have a home page of either index.php or default.asp

The web site would have a 404 error page and a Forbidden (access) page.
