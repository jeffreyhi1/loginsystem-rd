A page to disable a user account.

= Introduction =

It is not impossible that a malicious user could obtain the userid and email address of another person and reset their password.


= Details =

If a password has been changed an email will be sent to the account owner. If the web developer chooses, an option in the login system configuration would cause a link to be sent to the account owner in the "password has been changed" email. Following the link would lock the user account and send an email to the webmaster.
