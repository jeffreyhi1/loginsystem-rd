There are ancillary issues of concern in the project

Code Review:



Check points:

  * Locale set - loginGlobals?
  * Character set UTF-8 both in server side code and headers
  * Input canoncalized
  * Input filtered
  * Input escaped if necessary for database (may not be needed given the following
  * Parameterized SQL used
  * Stored procedures used

Database notes:

MS Access has two oledb providers, Jet 4 for 2003 and earlier
                                   Client Access Services for 2007 and later.
For the test system:

MS Access has no comments and does not allow stacked queries.
CONNECTION_STRING = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source='D:\Hosting\4707086\html\login-system\asp\database\login_system.mdb'"



MySql does have comments but no stacked queries.
MySql_real_escape_string will not stop all SQL Injection

MS SQL has comments and accepts stacked queries.

Should we defer to other major frameworks or proceed with the project in a way that is accessible to newer developers without the overhead of implementing another projects framework which may be not easily assimilated by the general developers.
