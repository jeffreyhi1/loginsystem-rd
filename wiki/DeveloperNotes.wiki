Database notes:

MS Access has two oledb providers, Jet 4 for 2003 and earlier
                                   Client Access Services for 2007 and later.
MS Access has no comments and does not allow stacked queries.

MySql does have comments but no stacked queries.
MySql_real_escape_string will not stop all SQL Injection

MS SQL has comments and accepts stacked queries.

Should we defer to other major frameworks or proceed with the project in a way that is accessible to newer developers without the overhead of implementing another projects framework which may be not easily assimilated by the general developers.
