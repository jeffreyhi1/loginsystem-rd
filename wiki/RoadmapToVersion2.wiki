Roadmap, Goals and Objectives For Version 2

= Introduction =

You didn't think this would end with Version 1 did you?


= Details =

Version 1 is essentially mapped out. It isn't finished but it is clear what it will look like. Oh we might add a gadget or two, but it is essentially done from an implementation and planning perspective.  The ASP.NET group and Cold Fusion group are in catch up mode but will probably have their Release 1.0 package done about the same time the ASP/PHP team does.

Richard Quadling and I had a discussion today about improvements which we may wish to implement in Version 2. Some of this comes from a QA and maintenance stand point, and I can tell you that attempting to maintain what will soon be 18 different language packages (we shall have Greek) is not fun and is time consuming.

Version 2 may be mostly about abstraction and unit testing, but there are many people now involved and all will have contributions to this discussion.

I will summarize the conversation I had with RQ and post it here as soon as possible.
