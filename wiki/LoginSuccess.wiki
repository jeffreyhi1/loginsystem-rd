The Login Success Page

= Introduction =

Upon successful login the user will be redirected in one of three ways:

#  If the user arrived at a protected page and was redirected to the login page they will
   be redirected back to the original page,
#  If the web developer has a specific page hard coded into the login, such as a forum
   landing page, the user will be redirected to that page, (advanced), or
#  The user will be redirected to the Login Success page.


= Details =

The Login Success page provides no special functionality beyond confirming a user has logged in successfully.  If used, the page should be customized to provide suggested links to other pages in the site.
