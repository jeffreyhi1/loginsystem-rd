CHANGE LOG
alpha 0.3/0.3a/0.4 to alpha 0.5
1. ASP /login-system/include/login.asp had an error on lines: 101 and 103 where a period (PHP concatenation character) was used instead of an ampersand.
2. ASP /login-system/include/form_error.asp had
	Option Explicit
	Session.CodePage=65001
	Response.Charset="UTF-8"
which were already defined (properly) in /login-system/form_error.asp
	
Two language constants were not spelled correctly. (This did not cause an error, but was incorrect)
langage files and code were corrected to the proper spellings.
Added the Polish language translation.

Issues 31, 34, 45

1. Minimum password length available
2. Minimum password bit entropy (randomness) available
3. The remember me checkbox can be turned of on login.asp (Set: lg_term_remember to false)

Added a number of constants to loginGlobals.asp to support strong passwords and the password strength meter used on #2 above.

All bugs recently have been string errors, usually in debug messages. Often a
missing " or &.


alpha 0.5a to alpha 0.5a (Bug fixes)

Issue 54:Password strength meter is a field. It could get focus and accept user input. Changed 
	to readonly and added tabindex to the page form fields to bypass meter.
Issue 55:issue-verification-token needed a "Click here to continue" link to the home page. Done.
Issue 56:New Registration EMail (ASP) failed to properly display hyperlink to contact the webmaster.
Issue 57:issue-verification-token.php Addressing the verification e-mail to  which does not exist, 
	needs to be changed to lg_term_register_confirmation.
Issue 58:login.php was not modified to accept $_POST["password"] therefore would not work with
	strong passwords.
Issue 59:cancel-account.php was not set to accept $_POST["password"] therefore could not handle 
	strong passwords.
Issue 60:cancel-account.asp had no "Click to continue link."
Issue 61:cancel-account.php, change-password.php, register.php, set-new-password.php All were set 
to substr($_POST["password"],0,255); and should have been substr($_POST["password"],0,254);
