Cancel Registration Page

# Introduction #

As discussed in the [The Login Process](http://code.google.com/p/loginsystem-rd/wiki/TheLoginProcess) a person could register for an account and later wish to cancel their account.


# Details #

If a user wishes to cancel their account they must enter their userid and password in the Cancel Account page. If the userid and password are valid the account id deleted and the user is shown a confirmation message.

Future implementations will send an account cancellation email to the user, just in case another person obtained their credentials and canceled the account without the account owner's permission or knowledge.

Future implementations may also include an option in the Login System's Globals file to mark a record as deleted and not actually remove the information.
