When you create a new file, you will need to set the svn properties.

You can set them globally, but not on a per-project basis which is a pain.

I've created a standalone batch script to do a lot of the work for you:

    lgkwds.bat.

Just edit the 6th line to set the correct location of the svn checkout.

For example, from 

CD /D "D:\Checkouts\loginsystem-rd"

to

CD /D "Z:\OpenSource\SVN Checkouts\loginsystem-rd"



When correctly edited and ran, run a commit to push the new file properties.

Only missing entries will be posted.

It will only look as .PHP, .ASP, .SQL and .BAT files. Other file types can
easily be added (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)

The files really should be plain text files and allow for the text ...

$Id$

to be included as a comment.

This will be expanded to something like ...

$Id: issue_verification_token.php 310 2010-05-07 03:26:50Z rdivilbiss $

This includes :

The name of the file : issue_verification_token.php
The SVN revision number : 310
The zulu date and time of the commit : 2010-05-07 03:26:50Z
And the person who made the change : rdivilbiss

All changes committed at the same time have the same revision number.

For files with fixed formats or binary files, no editing should take place.
