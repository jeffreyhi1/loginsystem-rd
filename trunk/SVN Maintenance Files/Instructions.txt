When you create a new file, you will need to set the svn properties.

You can set them globally, but not on a per-project basis which is a pain.

I use the attached files to keep PHPDOC uptodate (SVNKwds.bat and SVNKeywords.txt).

I've created a standalone version for loginsystem-rd (LGKwds.bat).

Just edit the 4th line to set the correct location of the svn checkout.

When setup and ran, run a commit to push the new file properties.

Only missing entries will be posted.

It will only look as .PHP, .ASP and .SQL files. Other file types can easily be added (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)

The files really should be plain text files and allow for the text ...
