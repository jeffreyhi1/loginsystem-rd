langage files and code were corrected to the proper spellings.

alpha 0.3 to alpha 0.5a (there was no alpha 0.4 in PHP code)
All loginGlobals.php files had constants added to support

related markup files were modified for strong passwords 
including a password strength meter when bit entropy is used.

Assorted bugs squashed where found

alpha 0.5a to alpha 0.5a (Bug fixes)

Issue 54:Password strength meter is a field. It could get focus and accept user input. Changed

Issue 56:New Registration EMail (ASP) failed to properly display hyperlink to contact the webmaster.
Issue 57:issue-verification-token.php Addressing the verification e-mail to  which does not exist, 
	needs to be changed to lg_term_register_confirmation.
Issue 58:login.php was not modified to accept $_POST["password"] therefore would not work with
	strong passwords.
Issue 59:cancel-account.php was not set to accept $_POST["password"] therefore could not handle 
	strong passwords.
