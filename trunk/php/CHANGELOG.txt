CHANGE LOG
alpha 0.2 to alpha 0.3
two language constants were not spelled correctly.
langage files and code were corrected to the proper spellings.
Added the Polish language translation.

alpha 0.3 to alpha 0.5 (there was no alpha 0.4 in PHP code)
All loginGlobals.php files had constants added to support
password length, or password bit entropy (randomness).

Change_password.php, register.php, set_new_password.php & 
related markup files were modified for strong passwords 
including a password strength meter when bit entropy is used.

Login-markup.php was modified to disable the "Remember Me"
cookie function if lg_term_remember = false in loginGlobals.php.
