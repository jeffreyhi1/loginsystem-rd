CHANGE LOG
alpha 0.2 to alpha 0.3
1. ASP /login-system/include/login.asp had an error on lines: 101 and 103 where a period (PHP concatenation character) was used instead of an ampersand.
2. ASP /login-system/include/form_error.asp had
	Option Explicit
	Session.CodePage=65001
	Response.Charset="UTF-8"
which were already defined (properly) in /login-system/form_error.asp
	
Two language constants were not spelled correctly. (This did not cause an error, but was incorrect)
langage files and code were corrected to the proper spellings.
Added the Polish language translation.
